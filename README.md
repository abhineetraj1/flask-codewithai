# Flask G-bot
This platform, built on Flask, enables users to submit their project requirements, such as the creation of a news website, via prompts. Upon submission, the server forwards the prompt to the Gemini API, which generates the requisite code and file structure. These generated files, comprising the user's project, are stored on the server, compressed into a zip file, and subsequently returned to the user. Following extraction, users can execute the desired HTML file to realize their project. Notably, this service extends beyond website development to encompass fields like machine learning, data science, and Flutter development, offering a versatile solution for various project needs.
